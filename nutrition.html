            <h3>Bulking Plan</h3>
            <p>Bulking is a phase focused on building muscle mass by eating in a calorie surplus—consuming more calories than the body requires
                for maintenance. Strength training is essential during this phase to ensure the extra energy fuels muscle growth rather than just
                fat accumulation. While gaining some fat is expected, the goal is to maximize muscle hypertrophy by carefully managing the surplus 
                and training intensity. Common foods during bulking include high-protein sources like chicken, eggs, and legumes, along with calorie-dense 
                options like rice, oats, and healthy fats. This phase typically lasts for several months and may be followed by a cutting phase to reduce the fat gained.

            <h3>Cutting Plan</h3>
            <p>Cutting focuses on reducing body fat while retaining as much muscle mass as possible. This is achieved through a calorie deficit, meaning fewer calories are 
                consumed than burned. Resistance training remains important to maintain muscle mass, while cardio exercises are often added to accelerate fat loss. A typical 
                cutting diet is high in protein to preserve muscle and emphasizes whole, nutrient-dense foods to support recovery and satiety. The cutting phase is 
                usually timed before competitions or events, lasting anywhere from 6 to 16 weeks, depending on how much fat needs to be lost.

            <h3>Weight Loss Plan</h3>
            <p>Weight loss refers to the reduction of overall body weight, which can include both fat and muscle. The primary goal is to create a sustainable calorie deficit 
                through a combination of diet and physical activity. While some people focus on cardio, others may include resistance training to prevent excessive muscle loss. 
                The approach to weight loss may vary depending on personal goals—whether it's for health reasons, aesthetics, or athletic performance. Unlike cutting, which 
                prioritizes muscle retention, weight loss may not always emphasize maintaining muscle mass. Long-term weight loss success often involves lifestyle changes, 
                such as healthier eating habits and regular exercise
